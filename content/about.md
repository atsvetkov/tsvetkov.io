Hi, I'm Alex! I have been working as a software engineer for the last 12 years, and now I am a Technical Lead in a software company in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

I have always enjoyed exploring all things .NET and creating high performance web applications. Besides programming, I like surfing, playing the guitar and tasting whisky.

You can find some of my code at [https://github.com/atsvetkov](https://github.com/atsvetkov), like this [dotnet-rocks](https://github.com/atsvetkov/dotnet-rocks) tool.
