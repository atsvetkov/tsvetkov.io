Hi, I'm Alex! I have been working as a software engineer for the last 12 years, and now I am a Technical Lead in a software company in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

I have always enjoyed exploring all things .NET and creating high performance web applications. Besides coding, I play the guitar and occasionally produce electronic music.
