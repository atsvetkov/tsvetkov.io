Hi, I'm Alex! I have been working as a software engineer for the last 11 or so years. Currently I am a Technical Lead in a software company in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

I've always enjoyed exploring all things .NET and creating web applications. My other passions besides coding are acoustic guitar, electronic music and surfing.
