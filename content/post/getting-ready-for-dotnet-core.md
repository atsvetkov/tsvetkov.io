* release is around the corner (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/02/09/visual-studio-2017-launch-event-and-20th-anniversary/)
* what can you do to prepare now (books, docs, vs2017, c# 7.0, understand .NET standard)
* still, makes sense to look at the new features in the latest RC version (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/02/07/announcing-net-core-tools-updates-in-vs-2017-rc)

* creating a custom dotnet command ("dotnet rocks")
* creating a custom project template for "dotnet" ("dotnet new .....")
