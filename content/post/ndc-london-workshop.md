Apparently last year I was a good boy, because Santa already made several of my dreams come true in 2017. This week I am visiting London and attending [NDC London](http://ndc-london.com/), one of the greatest and most inspiring conferences I know. Until now I only knew it by watching [numerous recorded talks from the past](https://vimeo.com/ndcconferences) and listetning to these top notch developers on [.NET Rocks](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/). Well, this morning I was in an elevator with [Scott Allen](http://odetocode.com/about/scott-allen), whose courses on PluralSight were the major part of my learning materials on ASP.NET. And when I stepped out of this elevator, first thing I heard was "Hi, I'm Richard Campbell" (that's exactly 50% of .NET Rocks). I know, it sounds silly, but I actually feel like a little boy meeting his all time football idol or something like that.

Anyway, enough emotions.

*Hell, I spent last two days on ASP.NET Core workshop with Damian Edwards, David Fowler and Jon Galloway!*

Ok, *now* I'm done with emotions. The workshop started from the very basic concepts (why .NET Core and how it is different) and gradually became more and more in-depth how-to session on various parts of .NET Core ecosystem, including hosting, configuration, tooling, logging, MVC and much more. We even found a couple of bugs in realtime (after all the VS tooling part is still RC)! Besides the sessions in a lecture format, we had a *lab* after each one, which were available [on github](https://github.com/jongalloway/aspnetcore-workshop). This part felt more like an individual exercise with a priceless bonus of having the authors of the framework in the same room.

It is hardly possible to describe all that I learned there, because that was *a lot* of information, like really *a lot*. We were taught the differences between running .NET Core apps from Visual Studio and directly from command-line, how certain environment variables influence the hosting behaviour, how flexible middlewares (or middlesware?) are compared to the old HTTP modules/handlers, how to configure logging and handle errors locally and on production environment. (***** DAY 2 *****)

That was a great experience and it certainly inspires to create and to share. Now that the pre-conference workshops are over, I'm looking forward to the next three days of talks from guys like Bill Wagner, Troy Hunt, Jon Skeet and Mark Seeman.

Lifelong learning FTW!
