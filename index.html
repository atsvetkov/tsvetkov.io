            Last three days of NDC London presented a constant paradox of choice, since every hour 7-8 speakers would have parallel sessions in different rooms. How the hell am I supposed to pick only one, if all of them are great? How on earth can you choose between Jon Skeet and Mark Seeman? My way of solving this problem was to spend an hour every evening going through the list of the next day&rsquo;s speakers and googling their talks from the past.

            Apparently last year I was a good boy, because Santa has already made several of my dreams come true in 2017. This week I am visiting London and attending NDC London, one of the greatest and most inspiring conferences I am aware of. Until now I only knew it by watching numerous recorded talks from the past and listetning to these top notch developers on .NET Rocks. Well, this morning I was in an elevator with Scott Allen, whose courses on PluralSight were the major part of my learning materials on ASP.

            Happy New Year everyone and thank you for reading this blog!
I decided to slightly modify the format of this series, so that the posts have only 3-5 links, but carefully selected and more focused ones. Information overload isn&rsquo;t a joke and trying to learn everything is often counterproductive (ask me how I know it), while picking your battles and practicing deep reading helps internalize things you read.
 Making the fastest site in the world David Gilbertson wrote a fascinating and hilarious post about frontend optimization techniques, which you may or may not know.

            A new Release Candidate of Visual Studio 2017 has been released recently, featuring faster installation and solution loading, an updated project file format, improved IntelliSense, better navigation, and some new built-in refactoring actions covering a significant part of commonly used ReSharper functionality. In this post we will look briefly into these items and will also do a small coding exercise to demonstrate some cool features of C# 7.0.

            News  Google keeps working on self-driving cars, now as Waymo, a separate company under Alphabet. It&rsquo;s also interesting to read about the changes in Google&rsquo;s business and internal projects during last years. Despite all the experiments they are doing, a major part of the revenue still comes from advertising. But company leaders claim that this as a tool to achieve more significant goals rather than a goal on its own.

            Contrary to what you might believe, merely doing your job every day doesn&rsquo;t qualify as real practice. Going to meetings isn&rsquo;t practicing your people skills, and replying to mail isn&rsquo;t practicing your typing. You have to set aside some time once in a while and do focused practice in order to get better at something.
 (Steve Yegge, Practicing Programming)
I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. More often than not we developers tend to write code only during working hours.

            This was a week of Microsoft Connect 2016, an event where yet another bunch of cool announcements were made. However, being a good software engineer means not restricting yourself to a single technology, so I have some awesome non-Microsoft things to share as well. Let&rsquo;s jump straight in!
 News  Microsoft used to be one of those companies on the far end on the &ldquo;opensourceness&rdquo; spectrum, and .NET itself seemed to be almost an antonim of &ldquo;open source&rdquo;.

            Sometimes I find interesting things on the web, which don&rsquo;t belong to a single category. Just random articles or news about technology. Since I still want to share these findings and because I normally do this kind of reading at the start of the day, I will be publishing this as a Coffee and links digest.
 News  This autumn Microsoft has launched Windows Server 2016, with lots of improvements and new features, like containers support (Docker containers can now natively run on Windows) and a lightweight GUI-less version called Nano Server (small, fast, and perfect as a hosting platform).

            Before we start, let me ask you a question: do you know what is the oldest still active open source .NET project?
Today I was again listening to awesome .NET Rocks podcast and the guest was Rob Mensching, the guy behind Wix Toolset. WiX provides a bunch of tools to simplify the creation of MSI packages for Windows, and as far as I know, it is one of the most popular open-source implementations in that area.

            Imagine a software developer working in a typical enterprise IT company. Let&rsquo;s call him Johnny. Most of the time Johnny works with .NET applications. He&rsquo;s been writing web apps since the days of ASP (he feels pretty comfortable with Web Forms and IIS after all these years), but he was always too busy doing important things and never really had time to follow the news in the industry. Yeah, he heard some folks in another department are using &ldquo;MVC&rdquo;, and somebody mentioned something like &ldquo;core&rdquo; or &ldquo;standard&rdquo;.

            Earlier this year I was assigned to a role of a technical lead in a small development team. This happened after working in the same team for more than a year and then being a part of a two-person architecture team focused on evaluating the microservices approach for a couple of months. At my current employer things are changing quickly and people are free to figure out what the idea actually was.

            With great power comes great responsibility, they say. In case of being a programmer, this sometimes means that achieving simple things may get complicated. I understand that WordPress essentially won as the blogging platform and you can setup your hosted blog in almost no time&hellip; but then where is all the fun? On the other hand, putting on a pragmatic programmer&rsquo;s hat, I don&rsquo;t really have time or desire to write my own blog engine either.

            It wasn&rsquo;t until this year that I decided to start blogging. A lot of things changed since moving from Russia to the Netherlands more than a year ago, in both life and work. At my current employer we are undergoing a tough and sometimes painful process of migrating our software architecture and development process to a presumably better state - and I am right in the middle of it. There are plenty discussions and experiments, some of them I hope might be worth sharing with the community.
