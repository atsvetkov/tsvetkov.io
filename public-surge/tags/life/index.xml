      <title>Never too late</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until this year that I decided to start blogging. A lot of things changed since moving from Russia to the Netherlands more than a year ago, in both life and work. At my current employer we are undergoing a tough and sometimes painful process of migrating our software architecture and development process to a presumably better state - and I am right in the middle of it. There are plenty discussions and experiments, some of them I hope might be worth sharing with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial goal is to write at least one post a week (feel free to poke me if I don&amp;rsquo;t). And I think in the actual first one (&lt;em&gt;every programmer&amp;rsquo;s posts should be zero-indexed, right?&lt;/em&gt;) I am going to describe the technical parts behind this very blog.&lt;/p&gt;
