                  		Current state of .NET

				<span class="post-date">Oct 18, 2016</span>
				<p>Imagine a software developer working in a typical enterprise IT company. Let&rsquo;s call him Johnny. Most of the time Johnny works with .NET applications. He&rsquo;s been writing web apps since the days of ASP (he feels pretty comfortable with Web Forms and IIS after all these years), but he was always too busy doing <em>important things</em> and never really had time to follow the news in the industry. Yeah, he heard some folks in another department are using &ldquo;MVC&rdquo;, and somebody mentioned something like &ldquo;core&rdquo; or &ldquo;standard&rdquo;. And some fellow .NET developers were even talking about Linux at the coffee machine. What? <em>.NET</em> and <em>Linux</em>? Weird!</p>

<p>Or is it?</p>

<p>Johhny feels that he might have been missing something important going on, but he is a bit afraid to ask his colleagues (after all, his title clear says he is a <em>Senior Developer</em>). So Johhny arranges a meeting with Dave, his former colleague, who left the company a long time ago to join some fancy startup. In fact, Johnny thinks that Dave is a total hipster and a nerd obsessed with new shiny frameworks&hellip; well, at least they are friends, so it&rsquo;s OK to look less competent. So Johnny asks something like &ldquo;what&rsquo;s new in .NET&rdquo; - and Dave opens a whole new world to him.</p>

<p>What could be the most exciting new possibilities in today&rsquo;s .NET ecosystem that Johnny learned about? Let&rsquo;s look at Dave&rsquo;s <em>Top 5 Reasons Why .NET Is So Awesome Today</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>.NET is now <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/">completely open-source</a>. If you ever wondered how LINQ&rsquo;s <code>Count()</code> method worked, now you can <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Linq/src/System/Linq/Count.cs">look it up on GitHub</a>. For example, you can see that before even trying to iterate the whole sequence (which might be time-consuming), they check if this sequence is actually a collection (which preserves a &lsquo;Count&rsquo; property), and if it is, then the collection&rsquo;s <code>Count</code> is returned, making it O(1) operation instead of O(n):</p>

<pre><code>ICollection collection = source as ICollection;
if (collection != null)
{
    return collection.Count;
}
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>The newest version of the framework is called <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/platform">.NET Core</a> and is completely cross-platform (not only you can <a href="https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/publishing/linuxproduction.html">run .NET apps on Linux</a>, you can even have the <a href="http://piotrgankiewicz.com/2016/10/17/net-on-linux-bye-windows-10/">whole development environment on Linux too</a>). And the new command-line tool <code>dotnet</code> allows to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExploringTheNewNETDotnetCommandLineInterfaceCLI.aspx">scaffold, build and run the application on all platforms</a>, just like this:</p>

<pre><code>dotnet new
dotnet build
dotnet run
</code></pre></li>

<li><p><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/03/07/announcing-sql-server-on-linux">SQL Server 2016 is going to run on Linux too</a>, which is exciting news for the companies that want to reduce costs of licencing and hosting.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/08/24/whats-new-in-csharp-7-0/">Next version of C# (7.0)</a> will contain even more features inspired by functional languages: there will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching">pattern matching</a>, real tuples, local functions and deconstruction syntax support. For example, we will be able to write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void Foo()
{
    // local function
    (string firstName, string secondName) GetTwo()
    {
            // returns a tuple
            return (&quot;Johnny&quot;, &quot;Dave&quot;);
    }

    // deconstruction into two variables at once
    (var first, var second) = GetTwo();
}
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>If just having functional features in an object-oriented language is not enough, you can easily switch to <a href="http://fsharp.org/">F#</a>, a functional language for .NET platform. It is becoming more and more popular in the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/why-fsharp-in-2015/">finance</a> <a href="https://fsharp.tv/gazettes/f-the-most-highly-paid-tech-worldwide-in-2016/">industry</a> and has frameworks for web development too, like <a href="http://websharper.com/">WebSharper</a> and <a href="https://suave.io/">Suave</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously this is just the tip of the iceberg. Johnny has a lot to catch up, but he already feels very much inspired. This is clearly not the same .NET world where he started his career many years ago: everything is changing and Microsoft is making .NET a very attractive platform for all kinds of applications. It&rsquo;s a great time to be a .NET developer, so Johnny decides that he needs to meet with Dave more often, read more developer-oriented resources and also try some new shiny stuff out.</p>

<p>Be like Johnny! Embrace change and learn amazing things!</p>
